{"instruction":"Answer the question using context-grounded explanation.","input":"What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?","output":"RAG is a method where a system first retrieves relevant context from documents and then generates an answer using that context."}
{"instruction":"Answer the question using context-grounded explanation.","input":"Why is chunk overlap used in RAG pipelines?","output":"Chunk overlap preserves context continuity across boundaries so relevant details are less likely to be lost during retrieval."}
{"instruction":"Answer the question using context-grounded explanation.","input":"How does reranking improve retrieval quality?","output":"Reranking reorders initially retrieved chunks using a stronger relevance signal, improving the final context passed to the language model."}
